md5()  hash security vulnerability  to rainbow tables. 
sha1() hash security vulnerability is vulnerable to ranbow tables.
hash() is fast and therefore there is a security vulnerability to brute force.
crypt() is deliberatly slower and contains a perameter to delay decryption even longer.

uniqid() generates unique string of characters...documentation does not recommend its use in crypting for salt;
random_bytes() is recommended to generate a random salt.

#Salted hash
    $password = 'secret';
    $salt =random_bytes(16);

    $password_hashed = crypt($password, $salt);


password_hash($string_password) is a newer PHP function that does all the work of the above.
